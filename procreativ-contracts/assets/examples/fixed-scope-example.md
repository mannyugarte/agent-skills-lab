## Schedule A: Scope of Work

THIS SCHEDULE A is made as of _______________ (the "Effective Date") by and between **ProCreativ Solutions LLC** and **Cirkul, Inc.** ("Client").

This Schedule A is incorporated into and made part of the Master Service Agreement between the parties.

### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

#### 1.1 Project Name
Cirkul Website Visual Refresh

#### 1.2 Project Objective
Transform drinkcirkul.com from its current "sterile, SaaS-like" visual presentation into a vibrant, flavor-forward beverage brand experience that creates an immediate emotional connection with visitors, improves new customer conversion rates, establishes a scalable visual system for 150+ flavor SKUs, provides A/B testable assets for performance optimization, and supports the Q1 2026 marketing initiative timeline.

#### 1.3 Background
Client operates a direct-to-consumer flavored water cartridge business with a razor/razorblade model. The current website underperforms in new-customer conversion due to product complexity and a lack of visual brand energy compared to competitors (Olipop, AG1, Bloom). This engagement focuses on visual and brand transformation—specifically color systems and product imagery—rather than a complete UI/UX redesign.
