# Manny Voice Guide

## Voice DNA

### Natural Patterns to Preserve

**Think in questions, then answer them**
- "What's the purpose of design? If the internet went down tomorrow... would it matter?"
- Don't lecture—explore out loud
- Questions create hooks and invite the viewer in

**Use "right?" as a checkpoint**
- Invites agreement, keeps viewer with you
- Don't edit this out—it's part of the rhythm
- Example: "We're competing for attention, right?"

**Build arguments through concrete examples**
- Cybertruck vs F-150
- Real estate reality shows
- Attractive people on social media
- Abstract concepts become tangible through comparison

**End with forward motion, not conclusions**
- "This might take a more clear shape... we'll see how it develops"
- Open loops are authentic, not weak
- Leaves room for follow-up content

### Sentence Rhythm

- Mix short punchy ("Aesthetics matter.") with longer exploratory thoughts
- "So, yeah" and "we'll see" are natural landing pads—not filler
- "Like" and "you know" in moderation = conversational, not sloppy
- Each script line: 8-15 words max for clean delivery

### Intellectual Fingerprint

- Challenge assumptions by removing context ("if X didn't exist...")
- Distinguish between related concepts precisely (aesthetics ≠ design, but aesthetics ∈ design)
- Tie abstract ideas to concrete stakes ("we're competing for attention")
- Comfortable saying "I don't have the full answer yet"

## The Cringe List (Never Use)

- "Let me unpack this"
- Excessive emoji strings
- "Here's the thing about hustle culture"
- Generic motivational platitudes
- Sales pitch disguised as value
- Over-produced, curated vibes
- "Game-changer," "crushing it," "level up"
- Starting with "So," when it's not natural
- Fake enthusiasm or hype energy

## Tone Calibration

| Attribute | Setting |
|-----------|---------|
| Sarcasm | Light, not mean |
| Self-deprecation | Yes, keeps it human |
| Directness | High—no hedging |
| Energy | Confident but not hype |
| Polish | Intentionally imperfect |

## Authenticity Tests

Before finalizing any script, verify:

1. **Would I say this to my mentee?**
2. **Does this sound like a text I'd send to Won or Andres?**
3. **If I read this in 6 months, will I cringe?**
4. **Am I exploring or lecturing?**

## Anti-BS Filter

Every piece of content must pass:

1. **Experience Test:** Have I actually done this, or am I theorizing?
2. **Receipt Test:** Can I back this up with evidence, examples, or outcomes?
3. **Specificity Test:** Is this generic advice anyone could give, or distinctly my perspective?
4. **Motive Test:** Am I providing value, or disguising a pitch as value?

If it fails any test, rework or kill it.
